# Cherdle
https://liammcph.github.io/chess_puzzle_game_Cherdle/

A chess puzzle game in Wordle format where your move inputs are highlighted in orange/green to indicate correctness.

## Description

Cherdle combines the strategic depth of chess puzzles with the feedback-driven gameplay of Wordle. Unlike traditional chess puzzles where you submit one move at a time, Cherdle challenges you to think through the entire sequence of a puzzle before receiving feedback.

I picked this project because I like chess and used to play Wordle, and thought it could be a fun way to combine the two games. It pushes you to think through whole sequences rather than individual moves.
